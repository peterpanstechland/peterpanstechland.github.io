# Peter Pan's Techland

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

For Chinese locale:

```bash
npm run start:zh
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Preview Build

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when you push to the `main` branch.

Manual deployment:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
