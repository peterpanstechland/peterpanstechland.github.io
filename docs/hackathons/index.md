# 🏆 Hackathon Portfolio

Welcome to my hackathon journey! Here you'll find projects, code, and learnings from various hackathons I've participated in.

## Why Hackathons?

Hackathons are an incredible way to:
- 🚀 **Rapid Prototyping** - Build MVPs in 24-48 hours
- 🤝 **Networking** - Meet like-minded developers and mentors
- 📚 **Learning** - Dive deep into new technologies under pressure
- 🎯 **Problem Solving** - Tackle real-world challenges creatively

## 💡 Tips for Hackathon Success

1. **Prep Your Toolkit** - Have boilerplate code ready
2. **Start with the Demo** - Build backwards from the pitch
3. **Use Managed Services** - Don't waste time on infrastructure
4. **Document as You Go** - Screenshots and notes for the pitch
5. **Sleep is Optional** - Coffee is mandatory ☕
