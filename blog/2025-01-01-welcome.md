# Welcome! 🎉

Welcome to **Peter Pan's Techland** - my personal space for documenting the journey of building intelligent systems that bridge cloud and edge.

<!-- truncate -->

## What to Expect

This site will feature:

- **Projects**: End-to-end builds from hardware to cloud deployment
- **Guides**: Reusable tutorials for AWS, edge devices, and AI/ML
- **Workshops**: Hands-on materials for community events
- **Blog**: Thoughts, learnings, and experiences along the way

## My Focus

I work at the intersection of three exciting areas:

1. **AI & Machine Learning** - Amazon Bedrock, Nova models, edge inference
2. **Edge Computing** - ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Jetson, and more
3. **AWS Cloud Services** - IoT Core, Greengrass, Lambda, and beyond
